## Overview

A unified simulation and control framework for unconventional modular robotic systems.

The work focused on enabling flexible manipulator configurations through dynamic model generation and hardware integration.

---

## System Capabilities

- Custom URDF generation pipeline
- Modular kinematic chain construction
- Real-time control framework
- MoveIt integration for arbitrary manipulator configurations
- Deployment on physical hardware (custom manipulator + UR10)

---

## Engineering Focus

- Abstraction of kinematic configuration
- Reusable robot modeling infrastructure
- Hardware-software alignment
- Clean interface between planning and execution layers

---

## Outcome

A scalable architecture for modular robotics research and rapid manipulator prototyping.
