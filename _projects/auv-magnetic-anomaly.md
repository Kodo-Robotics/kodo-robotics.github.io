title: "AUV Magnetic Anomaly Simulation"
excerpt: "Underwater vehicle simulation with magnetic field modeling and adaptive waypoint navigation."
---

## Overview

A physics-driven simulation of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) operating in a synthetic magnetic field environment.

The system models magnetic anomalies and integrates sensor feedback into navigation behavior.

---

## System Components

- Custom Gazebo plugins for magnetic field sensing
- Frequency-based magnetic anomaly modeling
- AUV kinematic and dynamic simulation
- Adaptive waypoint navigation with disturbance handling
- Minimal digital twin of real-world magnetic field conditions

---

## Engineering Focus

- Plugin-level simulation fidelity
- Sensor modeling abstraction
- Environment-to-control feedback loop

---

## Outcome

A modular underwater autonomy framework demonstrating how synthetic sensor models can drive adaptive navigation strategies.
