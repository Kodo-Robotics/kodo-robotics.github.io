## Engineering Notes

Technical reflections on building reliable robotic systems.

This is not a tutorial feed.  
It is a record of architectural decisions, system trade-offs, and lessons learned while developing autonomous robotics software.

### What You’ll Find Here

- ROS 2 system architecture design
- Navigation and manipulation integration
- Simulation-to-hardware workflows
- Motion planning and control strategies
- Deployment engineering for real-world robotics

---

### Philosophy

Robotics software must be:

- Deterministic
- Modular
- Reproducible
- Simulation-validated
- Hardware-aware

Precision in software defines performance in hardware.
