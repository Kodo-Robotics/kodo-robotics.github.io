# Kodo Robotics

## Code for the future of robotics.

We build reliable software infrastructure for autonomous robotic systems.

From simulation to hardware deployment, we design ROS 2 based architectures that scale — cleanly, deterministically, and production-ready.

---

## What We Do

### Autonomous Systems
Navigation stacks, SLAM integration, state estimation, and motion planning pipelines built on ROS 2 and Nav2.

### Manipulation Software
MoveIt 2 integration, trajectory generation, RRT planning, grasp pipelines, and collision debugging.

### Simulation & Validation
High-fidelity simulation using Gazebo, Isaac Sim, Unreal Engine, and custom physics setups.

### Deployment Engineering
Dockerized ROS 2 environments, CI/CD pipelines, embedded Linux deployments on NVIDIA Jetson and Intel NUC.

## Our Philosophy

- Systems over hacks  
- Deterministic behavior  
- Simulation-first validation  
- Clean architecture  
- Reproducible builds  

Precision in code. Reliability in execution.
